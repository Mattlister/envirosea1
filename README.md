Envirosea

Envirosea is a website dedicated to preserving our oceans and helping to save all marine life. This is something we must do in vain
to help the future of the planet or it will die. The oceans provide the planet with so many resources and without it, the world has 
no chance of life. The greatest killer of the sea is plastic. Plastic has been around since the 19 and its uses have grown and grown 
to become one of the most common materials in life. It's not a natural material, not a natural resource but it's everywhere and the
frightening fact behind it is, it doesn't work with the rest of the planet. It kills the planet. This man made material can not be 
broken down, it will not go away on it's own for thousands of years. It just sits there and helps to kill all of the natural resources
of the planet. Envirosea has been designed to showcase what plastic is doing to our oceans. What it's killing and how it's going to take
an absolutely huge cleanup to reverse it's affects. We need to stamp out plastic all over the planet. We can see what it's doing on land.
We can see the affect on land, we can gather up the plastics and work out what to do with it. In the ocean, it's a hidden killer and we
need to change this. Welcome to the Envirosea Project.

### Project Functionailty of Envirosea. 








full stack based project using business logic. The front end 

In this project, you'll build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. 
You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on
 the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.

Value provided:
By authenticating on the site and paying for some of its services, users can advance their own goals. Before authenticating, 
the site makes it clear how those goals would be furthered by the site. The site owner is able to make money by providing this 
set of services to the users. There is no way for a regular user to bypass the site's mechanisms and derive all of the value 
available to paid users without paying.
